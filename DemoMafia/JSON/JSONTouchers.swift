/*
 These are tasks that will allow the roles to disguise their actions. We could also use these to engage the townsfolk. We could also use these as part of a progression.
 Naturally, we will give a task for the mafia to fake. So the question "what was your task" doesn't doom a new mafia. We could also use these as a means for the mafia to disguise them talking.
 We could however use these as another source of clues.
 Unless the tasks are disabled.
